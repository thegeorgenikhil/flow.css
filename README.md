A modern component library to help you ship faster

Checkout the site [here](https://flow-css.netlify.app/)

# Usage

To use the library, add the following to your `<head>`:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://flow-css.netlify.app/components.css" />
```

## Starter Template

Be sure to have your pages set up with the latest design and development standards. That means using an HTML5 doctype and including a viewport meta tag for proper responsive behaviors. Put it all together and your pages should look like this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <!-- Required meta tags -->
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <!-- flow.css -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://flow-css.netlify.app/components.css" />
    <!-- FontAwsome CDN -->
    <link
      rel="stylesheet"
      href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.0.0/css/all.min.css"
    />
    <title>flow.css</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1 class="color-primary">Hello World</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```
